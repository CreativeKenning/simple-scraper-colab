# Welcome to Step by Step Scraping with BeautifulSoup! Make your own copy of this Colab to get started!

This colab notebook was made to help familiarize beginners the basics of scraping and parsing HTML. These modules use the "BeautifulSoup" Python library to introduce you to web scraping in a step-by-step, coding-optional environment. I've worked to comment everything to clarify (to the best of my ability) how everythng works.

This colab Notebook should help you with the basics of filtering and viewing HTML, learning to find specific HTML tags to scrape, scraping and exporting data from HTML, and simple webpage-crawling. While not comprehensive, I hope that the following tool is useful and instructive, and should work well with text-analysis tools such as Orange and AntConc. While this is meant to assist those interested in scraping, it is not meant to teach you how to code, or to build a scraper seperate from these instructions.


## Who is this for?
1. Academics with little to no coding experience, interested in learning how to parse HTML and scrape materials from webpages, or to simply engage in some simple scraping with no coding required, in a manner that can export CSV or TXT files for analysis.

## How to use
1. Follow the link to the notebook in Google Colab
2. Create a copy, and follow the directions therein to scrape and export website data
3. Download your CSV or txt file, and use [Orange](https://orangedatamining.com/) or, [AntConc](https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/) for further analysis.


## Disclaimer

Please keep in mind that these scrapers are set up for ease of use as an exploratory project by an academic and amatuer coder doing his best to learn python through practice. By setting up this simple scraper in Google Colab, my goal is to help other beginners to start scraping with Python as well. As such, keep in mind these scrapers are not made to be configured for multiple edge-cases: they cannot scrape from websites that implement rate-limitng or other measures to prevent scraping, and they cannot currently scrape multiple webpages for data at once. Also, please use these scrapers responsibly.
